                <p className="text-secondary">
                  Most People get comtable riding a electric skateboard after
                  just 10-15 min. The reason for that is, that with electrical
                  skateboards you just have to learn how to get on them, the
                  motor does the work for you, not your food that you have to
                  balance out each time. With our learning tutorials/provided
                  video you can enjoy your rented E-Skateboard for the day,
                  after learning riding it in a few minutes
